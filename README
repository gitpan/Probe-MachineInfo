NAME
    Probe::MachineInfo - The great new Probe::MachineInfo!

SYNOPSIS
    Probe::MachineInfo aims to be a set of collector/probe classes which
    allow the extraction of information about the configuration of a
    machine. For example the number of CPUs it has and how much memory it
    has.

    This release is really just a taster release of what's to come. The
    architecture may change quite a lot. At the moment there is a bit of a
    Unix bias because that's the type of operating system that I do almost
    all of my real work on. However I also hope to add support for Windows
    hosts at some earlyish stage.

    Quick summary of what the module does.

    Perhaps a little code snippet.

        use Probe::MachineInfo;

        my $foo = Probe::MachineInfo->new();
        ...

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
    I'll support any platform that I have experience of, or which someone
    will tell me is compatible with the existing code (e.g. another unix
    variant) or which someone will give me a patch for and help me test.

    *   Linux

    *   Solaris

    *   Microsoft Windows

INSTALLATION
    This module uses Module::Build for its installation. To install this
    module type the following:

      perl Build.PL
      ./Build
      ./Build test
      ./Build install

    If you do not have Module::Build type:

      perl Makefile.PL

    to fetch it. Or use CPAN or CPANPLUS and fetch it "manually".

DEPENDENCIES
    See the Build.PL for a list of dependencies
